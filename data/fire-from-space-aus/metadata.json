As a result, sub-pixel fire characterization (e.g., fire radiative power [FRP] retrieval) is only viable across small and/or low-intensity fires. Systematic FRP retrievals are based on a hybrid approach combining 375 and 750 m data. In fact, starting in 2015 the algorithm incorporated additional VIIRS channel M13 (3.973-4.128 \u00B5m) 750 m data in both aggregated and unaggregated format."},{"dataType":["sc:Text"],"source":{"fileObject":{"@id":"fire_nrt_V1_96617.csv_fileobject"},"extract":{"column":"daynight"}},"@id":"fire_nrt_V1_96617.csv/daynight","@type":"cr:Field","name":"daynight","description":"Day or Night: D= Daytime fire, N= Nighttime fire"}],"@id":"fire_nrt_V1_96617.csv","@type":"cr:RecordSet","name":"fire_nrt_V1_96617.csv","description":"VIIRS 375m NRT files:(VNP14IMGTDL) VIIRS Active Fire and Thermal Anomalies product processed by LANCE / FIRMS"}],"version":1,"keywords":["analysis \u003E geospatial analysis","geography and places \u003E oceania \u003E australia","subject \u003E arts and entertainment","subject \u003E earth and nature","subject \u003E people and society \u003E business","subject \u003E science and technology"],"isAccessibleForFree":true,"includedInDataCatalog":{"@type":"sc:DataCatalog","name":"Kaggle","url":"https://www.kaggle.com"},"creator":{"@type":"sc:Person","name":"Carlos Paradis","url":"/carlosparadis","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-avatars/thumbnails/1313433-kg.jpeg"},"publisher":{"@type":"sc:Organization","name":"Kaggle","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/organizations/kaggle","image":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-organizations/4/thumbnail.png"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-datasets-images/473032/886975/4d28444f1483149ba472791a704efb8f/dataset-card.jpg?t=2020-01-12-07-03-48","dateModified":"2020-01-12T06:52:03.397","datePublished":"2020-01-12T08:25:52.3289249","@type":"sc:Dataset","name":"Fires from Space: Australia","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosparadis/fires-from-space-australia-and-new-zeland/versions/1","description":"### Context\n\nCurrent news about Australia bushfire has been spreading fast, however, the same can\u0027t be said about the datasets. This NASA FIRMS MODIS and VIIRS Fire/Hotspot provide an initial dataset for fires in Australia. My main motivation to provide this dataset was the following article:\n\n- [BBC News - Australia fires: Misleading maps and pictures go viral](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-51020564) \n\nSee the Ideas Section at the bottom for more inspiration. \n\n\n### Content\n\nThe current dataset provides 4 tables from 2 NASA Satellite Instruments:\n\n- [MODIS C6](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/what-is-new-collection-6-modis-active-fire-data) Tables \n   - fire_archive_M6_96619.csv\n   - fire_nrt_M6_96619.csv\n\n- [VIIRS 375m](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/viirs-i-band-active-fire-data) Tables \n   - fire_archive_V1_96617.csv\n   - fire_nrt_V1_96617.csv\n\nThe provided URLs contain more details on the two instrument differences. Each instrument contains two types of tables: Near Real Time (\u0060_nrt_\u0060) and older standard/science quality data (\u0060_archive\u0060). According to the README provided with the dataset, NRT data are replaced with standard quality data when they are available (usually with a 2-3 month lag). This time-lag can be observed on the tables by verifying the \u0060acq_date\u0060 column (See available Kaggle Notebook). For more details between NRT and Archive see [this link](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/faq/firms-faq#ed-nrt-standard).\n\nMore information on the instruments used for this dataset can be found [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/wildfires-cant-hide-from-earth-observing-satellites) and [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms). All columns have been annotated with the description following Kaggle format. For data provenance, see the Metadata section. \n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe acknowledge the use of data and imagery from LANCE FIRMS operated by NASA\u0027s Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) with funding provided by NASA Headquarters. \n\nNRT VIIRS 375 m Active Fire product VNP14IMGT.

Some ideas:\n\n- [Australia fires: A visual guide to the bushfire crisis](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-50951043)\n- [Australia bushfires factcheck: are this year\u0027s fires unprecedented?](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/22/australia-bushfires-factcheck-are-this-years-fires-unprecedented) \n\nThere is also other information that can be combined with this dataset, such as local air quality, and local alerts to increase accuracy.\n\n### Found an error? Let me know! \n\nFeel free to post on Discussion anything strange you may find, and I will be happy to follow-up. "}
